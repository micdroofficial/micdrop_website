							<p>Ancient Germanic / Medieval  traditions involved Trial By Combat. Where two opposing parties would duel, where DIVINE INTERVENTION would decide the combatants innocence. TBC bridges the Gap between strategy and fighting style gameplay. Attempting to  capture an opponent sends both pieces into a 2D fighting game where you must defeat your opponent to finally capture the square! 3D Chess Meets 2D fighter! Rather than automatically capturing an opponents piece, both players are sent to a minigame where the victor takes the square!</p>
